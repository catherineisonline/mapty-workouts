# Mapty

Mapty is a map application made with Vanilla JavaScript to store workouts like running and cycling.

The user can choose any point on the map and choose between running or cycling. In order to submit the workout, the user needs to fill out several details like distance, duration, cadence or elevation. All the workout will be saved after choosing any new workout option.
If the user reloads the page, all the data will be saved.
